This wasn\u2019t about food quality \u2014 it was a paid item missing from the order. Support responded with a generic message instead of a solution. Taking money for undelivered items and denying refunds is unfair and disappointing. Very poor customer support."

First after changing till the light turns blue the right side has a percentage of 10% and the best thing is that the left side was not working. Thanks guys you made my day.

The only reason I came to Swiggy is because you give a variety of coupons. But now it seems they aren't worth cuz what's the point of coupons when you aren't fed when you're hungry."

Earlier, use to get prompt \" ordering from far\" now that is also stopped. This delays the time of delivery and also pay extra delivery charges for same item. Its frustrating. Its high time for swiggy to improve or soon people will disown swiggy. Dont play with customer to earn few extra bucks."

If you can\u2019t deliver on time, why charge for fast delivery at all? This feels like cheating customers. Very poor coordination and terrible service standards. This was my worst experience with Swiggy. Completely dissatisfied."

I recently ordered a walking stick for my father, who is 80 years old. Upon trial, he felt extremely uncomfortable and unsafe using the product due to its apparent fragility.This raised genuine safety concerns for us, which were immediately reported to your customer support team no help received"

Offers are misleading and give no real benefit. This service is becoming overpriced and not worth the money. Highly disappointing."

But when he tried to place order, he realised that the coupon validity was till 21 September 2025. please Swiggy don't fool people like this. If you want to give free cash give it with proper validity not with a coupon which expired 3 months back. I would have uploaded the coupon image if there was an option for the same."

Often, it highlights farther outlets instead of the closest ones, which unnecessarily increases delivery time to 45\u201350 minutes, even when the same restaurant has a nearer branch. As a customer, it would be much better if the app prioritized nearby stores or at least clearly showed all available outlets so we can choose the faster option.

Kindly never place an order from Dominos through the Swiggy app. I placed an order on the 16th of December, 2025. The order was not delivered and I did not receive my refund yet. Swiggy washed their hands asking me to contact Dominos directly. Dominos did not refund my money too. They will keep passing the buck. It's a racket to just keep the money without delivering the order. Please be careful. Hope this helps."

Offers on the App are mostly useless because the prices of food items in the app are very high as compared to restaurant's take away prices. Overall, I would rate you a big ZERO. You are following highly unethical business practices and I hope that one fine day the Indian legal system becomes so robust that companies like you think 100 times before harassing it's customers."

Just gave a part refund and closed the matter without providing a proper explanation of the issue. I would not use Swiggy ever. Point to note is that the instructions that we mention on swiggy for the restaurant to follow are not compulsory for them to follow. It's as per their discretion to follow or not to follow instructions. how pathetic is that."

I hope you continue to do proper handling of orders and good help service this would definitely be worthy of 5 stars then, for now I'll give it another chance."
