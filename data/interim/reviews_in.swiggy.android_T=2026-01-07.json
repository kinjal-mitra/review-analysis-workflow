This wasn\u2019t about food quality \u2014 it was a paid item missing from the order. Support responded with a generic message instead of a solution. Taking money for undelivered items and denying refunds is unfair and disappointing. Very poor customer support."

If we want to cancel the order, there is no cancellation option in the app. When I ask customer support to cancel my order then they will ask for 100% cancellation fee. This is a total scam where eventually the customer will have to pay in either of the scenarios. Why it is accepting order even when the payment is not even completed.

My emails were ignored, this is fraud. Kindly refund my money as soon as possible, otherwise be ready for fraud charges and for breaking customer's trust with these kind of cheap and low acts.

I know Zomato is your competition, just to let you know that I had never got a chance to contact their customer service even once. Surely, will go back to them. The only reason I came to Swiggy is because you give a variety of coupons. But now it seems they aren't worth cuz what's the point of coupons when you aren't fed when you're hungry."

They don't know how to chat with customers. Just copying statements from notes and pasting in chat box. But they won't resolve the issue. Instead of hiring agents, Develop a AI bot model to send this copy paste messages, Even that is better than your agents."
