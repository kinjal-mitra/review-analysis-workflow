Often, it highlights farther outlets instead of the closest ones, which unnecessarily increases delivery time to 45\u201350 minutes, even when the same restaurant has a nearer branch. As a customer, it would be much better if the app prioritized nearby stores or at least clearly showed all available outlets so we can choose the faster option.

Then they cannot find a delivery partner in time, leading to delayed orders almost every time. The food is cold.And the worst part is their customer support. You cannot get to talk to a real person, instead a bot only show the option of don't cancel my order even if the food is delayed by an hour. Pathetic experience."

Kindly never place an order from Dominos through the Swiggy app. I placed an order on the 16th of December, 2025. The order was not delivered and I did not receive my refund yet. Swiggy washed their hands asking me to contact Dominos directly. Dominos did not refund my money too. They will keep passing the buck. It's a racket to just keep the money without delivering the order. Please be careful. Hope this helps."
