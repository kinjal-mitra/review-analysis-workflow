And today, after placing an order at 7.36pm and trying to connect to a specialist to cancel the order which stated 1 min wait time for a specialist and getting connected at 7.38pm, I'm informed I've crossed the 1 min order limit for cancellations.

Food-Got a pizza order,packed horribly& toppings fell down in the box. Contents of pizza stuck to the box. even after that they gave me partial refund only after fighting for a longg time. I had to throw the pizza out, so my money got wasted, and I was still hungry. for something this obvious, they kept asking me to mail some ID and wait,why the hell should I wait and email?!"

If cancelled due to for any reason after placing the order,they charge 100 % amount. If the waiting time in a restaurant is 30 minutes, why do these food delivery services takes more than that, there should be maximum 30 minutes waiting time given by these providers or the entire amount should be refunded."

The timer shows 20 minutes since 40 minutes. Uninstalling this app now as hunger is dead already. Useless bot when you chat or seek help - no assistant."
