I raised a case with swiggy customer support and tried explaining them with every single detail along with photos, all they did was closed the chat without appropriate action and asked me to send mail. and in the mail they wrote Issue resolved with providing resolution. Dumbness of customer support team. Ridiculous behaviour."

I know Zomato is your competition, just to let you know that I had never got a chance to contact their customer service even once. Surely, will go back to them. The only reason I came to Swiggy is because you give a variety of coupons. But now it seems they aren't worth cuz what's the point of coupons when you aren't fed when you're hungry."
