Your customer support executive is not helpful at all, and your partner uses unprofessional language. All my coupons have been removed, and the customer care executive even charged me a cancellation fee for my Swiggy food order.

Kindly never place an order from Dominos through the Swiggy app. I placed an order on the 16th of December, 2025. The order was not delivered and I did not receive my refund yet. Swiggy washed their hands asking me to contact Dominos directly. Dominos did not refund my money too. They will keep passing the buck. It's a racket to just keep the money without delivering the order. Please be careful. Hope this helps.",
