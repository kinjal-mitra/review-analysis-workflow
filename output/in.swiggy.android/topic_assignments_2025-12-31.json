Swiggy Customer support is so so so much Poor They are not resolving issues. they are saying only NO and sending sympathy. I ordered at 31st December 2025. and I saw time is so much late so I tried to cancel that order they sent me very confusing msg that cancellation charges are similar to my order charges. I thought they were saying that they were giving me a full refund. I requested that order again but they denied.",
